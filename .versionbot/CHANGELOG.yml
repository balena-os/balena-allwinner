                Currently we are reading a package list from the contracts that
                mixes

                recipe and package names, and we run bitbake with the `-k` flag
                not to

                stop the build when a package name fails to match a recipe.


                The contracts have now been modified to specify either a
                `sw.recipe.yocto`

                or a `sw.package.yocto` so we can distinguish between them and
                use

                recipe names to build and package names to install.


                We also remove the continue flag from bitbake.

                By default we enable both which is the current dockerd default.

                When running a single docker daemon without the iptables and
                ipmasq flags,

                containers on the default bridge network cannot communite with
                the

                outside as no iptables rules are set.

                with the errexit option the script exists after sourcing this
                file.

                This commit masks the error as it may not be needed in the
                sourcing

                script.

                Also, fix the length of the short git release to avoid different
                git

                clients configuration mismatches.

                blocks with barys as frontend.

                Production versions have the OS release name and development
                versions get

                appended a .dev suffix. Once both image variants are merged only
                the OS

                release name will be used.

                This commit brings the bluez5 recipe from poky master as we need
                to control which bluez5 version is used in meta-balena.

                The code originates from poky's master branch -

              hash: ac0ba89f14c0b04b7353192f15a0634be44d910c

                Some BSPs have enabled CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HUNG_TASK_PANIC which

                can trigger panics upon high iowait, such as balena-engine

                downloading/writing a large image to disk.


                Kconfig says the following:

                    Say Y here to enable the kernel to panic on "hung tasks",
                    which are bugs that cause the kernel to leave a task stuck
                    in uninterruptible "D" state.

                    The panic can be used in combination with panic_timeout,
                    to cause the system to reboot automatically after a
                    hung task has been detected. This feature is useful for
                    high-availability systems that have uptime guarantees and
                    where a hung tasks must be resolved ASAP.

                    Say N if unsure.

                Hung tasks are not normally terminal, nor do they affect system

                stability, but panicking during an image write forces a device
                into a

                bootloop that requires manual intervention to remedy.


                See the below stacktrace:

                balena-engine hasn't transitioned to building with modules yet,
                and Go

                1.16 enabled them by default. Revert to the old behavior for now
                to fix
                  the build.

                This option will be removed in Go 1.17, so we'll have to update
                our

                build before upgrading further.

                Improve the handling of the os.network.* parameters defined in

                config.json.


                The balena-config-vars script has been updated to process the

                os.network.* parameters from config.json. This allows scripts

                to access these parameters by just including balena-config-vars

                rather than having to parse them directly. Some of the default

                settings have now been included as part of the jq parsing
                string.

                The jq command has also been assigned to an interim variable
                rather

                than being evaluated directly. This allows other scripts which

                include balena-config-vars to handle parsing errors correctly
                when

                they are running with 'set -e'.


                The os-networkmanager script has been updated to make use of the

                balena-config-vars script and no longer parses config.json
                itself.

                The logging has been standardised and the simplification of the

                variable processing has reduced the size of the script from 146

                to 101 lines.


                The build time tests have been removed as the os-networkmanager
                script

                is unable to access /usr/sbin/balena-config-vars at buildtime.

                        Show warning instead of exception for invalid network
                        config
                      hash: 5197a1330d69cbff97f3c53a77f640638e074b8a

                        A previous PR (#1656) fixed validation for network ipam
                        config,

                        checking that both network and subnet are defined for
                        each ipam config entry

                        (as described in the docker documentation).


                        After that PR, the validations throws an exception if
                        the network target state is incorrect,

                        but this turns out to be the wrong approach, because
                        that exception is also triggered

                        when querying target state.


                        This isn't a problem in normal operation, but it is in
                        local mode, because local

                        mode queries the old target state before sending a new
                        one. Since the query fails,

                        the CLI can never push the new target state.


                        This PR replaces the exception with a warning on the
                        logs, since a

                        misconfigured network won't cause any engine failures,
                        it will just

                        prevent containers to communicate through the provided
                        network.


                        A future improvement should move this validation to an
                        earlier point in the process,

                        so the target state can get rejected before it even gets
                        to a point it

                        can be used.

                        The `start-resin-supervisor` script in newer OS version
                        no longer uses the

                        SUPERVISOR_TAG environment variable setup on
                        supervisor.conf and

                        update-supervisor.conf.


                        This change removes the need for that variable with
                        livepush supervisor

                        to make it compatible with older and newer OS versions

                        'mz' can be safely replaced with fs.promises
                        and util.promisify for faster native methods.
                        'mkdirp' after Node v8 uses native fs.mkdir, thus
                        is redundant. 'body-parser' is deprecated and
                        contained within express v4.x.

                All the variables should be stored in grubenv file. This means

                bootcount, resin_root_part and upgrade_available variables need

                to be moved to grubenv.

                This is needed in preparation for storage migration from aufs to
                overlayfs.

                When running hostapp-update, we need to create the target
                hostapp on

                overlayfs, which implies the OS we update from can support both

                This brings in the aufs-to-overlay migrator. Which won't run
                until we

                configure the engine service to include an
                `BALENA_MIGRATE_OVERLAY=1`

                env var.


                The other notable change is the fix for

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/236 which
                allows

                `balena top` to work as expected on balenaOS

                We need to make sure the modem is completely initialized before
                sending

                the AT commands that do the switch to ECM mode. To achieve this
                we

                change the systemd service dependency to depend on
                ModemManager.service

                and then we determine the modem state by using mmcli and
                querying the

                modem power-state property.


                This procedure will only be done once. After the modem is placed
                in ECM

                mode, it will stay in this mode for future reboots so there will
                be no

                other delays in bringing up the modem connection.

                resin-mounts/etc-fake-hwclock: add dependency on resin-state
                services
              hash: 2b07011844a2738aec033d88af29e3f6e0dd28a2

                Added a dependency on resin-state.service and
                resin-state-reset.service

                to etc-fake-hwclock.mount.


                On initial boot after flashing a device the
                resin-state-reset.service

                was running after etc-fake-hwclock.mount causing the bind mount
                point

                /mnt/state/root-overlay/etc/fake-hwclock to be deleted after it
                had

                been mounted. This resulted in a failure to save the date/time
                at

                shutdown which caused problems with persistent logging at next
                boot.

                Subsequent boots are unaffected as resin-state-reset does not
                run.

                Adding a dependency on the resin-state services ensures that the

                bind mount point is created after the state reset has been
                performed.


                This issue was noticed when running the testbot unmanaged OS
                image

                persistent logging test. When running a managed OS image the
                device

                normally reboots fairly immediately after connecting to the

                balena-cloud host and receiving parameter updates, so this issue
                is

                not usually noticeable.

                At this moment resin_update_state_probe is scanning pretty much
                every

                block device for rootfs. This include ramdisks, zram and loop
                devices

                which, when scanned, even spam warnings in logs. This patch
                updates

                the udev rule to skip such devices and only trigger on add or
                change

                events.

              hash: 7983e9bfd716aaedad1ef5f1468b2771e1f5a71c
              body: >
                Previously we were loading the healthcheck image from it's own
                service

                that was previously made `PartOf=` the balena.service.

                This was done in an attempt to help get the system unstuck when
                the

                image is removed (like through manual pruning), which would
                cause the

                healthcheck to trigger the engine to reboot until the load
                service was

                restarted by hand.


                Further investigation found a race between the first execution
                of the

                engine healthcheck script (which needs the image to be loaded)
                and the

                loader service itself, which would lead to a similar state,
                requireing

                manual intervention.


                This change moves the loading into the healthcheck script
                itself,

                allowing us to remove the loader script and service entirely,
                skipping

                the whole service ordering issue.

                grub-efi requires modules to be installed in the boot partition,
                and

                resin-image installs them from ${DEPLOYDIR}.


                A normal grub installation installs those modules to
                ${PREFIX}/${libdir}

                to allow grub tooling to install them at runtime, but we're
                building the

                image with GRUB baked in, so we don't need those in the sysroot.


                The first iteration of this bbappend attempted to solve these

                constraints by copying the modules from ${D}/${libdir}/grub/ to

                ${DEPLOYDIR} in do_deploy(), then removing ${D}${prefix}. This
                had the

                unfortunate side effect of breaking the build in certain cases,
                such as

                clean builds or reexecuting do_deploy() without the other steps
                of the

                build.


                Instead, remove the unwanted files in do_install(), and append
                the

                required modules to GRUB_BUILDIN to create a standalone grub
                image

                without any external modules at all.

                initrdscripts: always use by-uuid symlink looking for flasher

                If the device with flasher rootfs is slow to bring up and rootfs
                is defined

                as UUID=xxx the waiting loop in rootfs initrd script would
                assume UUIDs have

                just been regenerated and wait for a by-state symlink instead.
                This only works

                for the OS - flasher does not use the dynamically generated
                UUIDs

                therefore we always want to use the by-uuid link for it.

                Replace the 'bind-etc-fake-hwclock.service' with a systemd mount

                unit (etc-fake\x2dhwclock.mount).


                Using a systemd service to bind mount the /etc/fake-hwclock
                directory

                results in systemd generating an internal mount unit for the
                same

                directory. This causes problems at shutdown when both methods
                try to

                unmount the directory. This frequently leads to the directory
                being

                unmounted before the fake-hwclock service has managed to save
                the

                system time. This results in an inaccurate fake-hwclock time

                at next boot and corruption of the journal log.

                either

                when it starts up or at runtime using the chrony-helper script.


                Add a dispatcher script to trigger the chrony online/offline

                status on network 'up' and 'down' events. This will make chrony

                re-run an iburst for sources when the appropriate network
                interface

                comes back up.

                Add the 'sourcedir' parameter to the chrony configuration to
                support

                dynamic source configuration files. Any NTP source files that
                are

                source configuration at runtime.


                Add a helper script to support the dynamic re-loading of chrony

                sources. This script uses the chrony 'reload sources' feature.

                Fixes #2075


                Needed were a number of various changes to make the package
                compile properly:


                Removed is
                0001-wwan-Set-MTU-based-on-what-ModemManager-exposes.patch that
                is now

                included upstream.


                Our patch for removing HTTPS connectivity checking warning is
                reworked for ease of

                maintainance. It now keeps the log entry, but changes it to
                debug level.


                Fixed are UPSTREAM_CHECK_* definitions as they referenced a
                wrong version number.


                The following additional configuration options were
                added/removed:


                *. Introspection is disabled through
                `--enable-introspection=no`. Other services do

                not depend on it, so it is safe to remove it. A related patch is
                no longer needed

                0002-Do-not-create-settings-settings-property-documentati.patch


                *. A new option for using firewalld zone for shared mode is
                disabled as we do not

                use firewalld.


                *. The polkit agent option no longer is available, so
                `--enable-polkit-agent` and

                `--disable-polkit-agent` are no longer defined.

                Replace busybox ps link with ps.procps without installing

                any other procps packages. This will avoid regression and bloat

                from swapping existing busybox links with procps variants.


                By using procps as docker expects we can properly handle ps args

                such as -e and -o to format output. Busybox is only capable of
                this

                when compiled in "desktop" mode.


                This upstream commit to poky has already split the ps binary
                into

                a separate procps package:

                So for now we can copy this recipe at the commit above into
                compat branches

                and use that version until we pick up a branch newer than
                gatesgarth.

              hash: e86c83e9be007bbedf5bad8bb961931c4f4f649c

                Fixes #1846


                UART modems (RaspberryPi HATs) are not working currently under

                balenaOS as NetworkManager times out while attempting to
                establish

                ppp connection. This is not a balenaOS specific issue.


                This commits adds a `connect ""` declaration to
                `/etc/ppp/options`

                to workaround this as the NULL default value causes the timeout.


                The connect option specifies an external script to establish the

                physical link. When using NetworkManager/ModemManager it is

                ModemManager that establishes the physical link before passing
                it

                to NetworkManager. Thus `connect` should be empty.

                This is necessary because node has its own built-in CA bundle
                and ignores

                the system-wide bundle. Bind-mount the system-wide bundle to the
                supervisor

                container as well to keep the previous behavior. Make it
                read-only though,

                any modifications should be performed by the host OS.

                Remove the kernel-devsrc package from meta-balena and
                use the one from the upstream Poky project instead.

                Initially I hoped thud and warrior could also use the respective
                upstreams but I see several differences between the meta-balena
                version and the upstreams so I updated those compat layers
                as well.

                Update chrony from version 3.4 to version 4.0.

                The new version has enhancements and new features that will
                help to improve time synchronisation, including:

                - the ability to add server pools via scripts using chronyc.
                - support for dynamic NTP source files that can be reloaded
                  as necessary (useful for DHCP and config.json sources).
                - source name options for improved handling of pool addresses.
                - repeat 'iburst' when a source is changed from offline to
                  online state.

                Ensure that the /var/log/supervisor-log directory exists prior
                to

                running 'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' as well as

                'runSupervisor'.


                Updates to the 'start-resin-supervisor' script in v2.62.1
                removed

                the check for updates to the REGISTRY_ENDPOINT variable.
                Previously

                this had been detected as changing every time the script was run

                due to a comparison between 'null' and ''. This resulted in the

                'start-resin-supervisor' script always running through the

                'runSupervisor' path. With this variable check removed, and no
                config

                updates being detected, the script was trying to run

                'balena start --attach resin_supervisor' and failing due to the

                absence of the /var/log/supervisor-log directory. To fix this
                problem we

                unconditionally test for and create this directory (if
                necessary) so

                that it is available regardless of the path taken through the
                script.

                Change the chrony UDP source port from 123 (privileged) to

                1234 (non-privileged).


                Previous issues with Phicomm routers had required the use of a
                fixed

                UDP source port, so port 123 was chosen as this is used by both
                ntpd

                and ntpdate. However recent testing has shown that using a
                privileged

                port such as 123 can cause issues on other networks. By changing
                the

                port to be non-privileged (i.e. 1234) we can satisfy both
                network

                requirements.

              hash: 1c1374f3c8b5914b7e645f8068ebafc8b4cbbe3a
              body: >
                The handling of the RTC at boot time has been improved as
                follows:


                1) A 'timeinit-rtc.sh' script has been added to improve logging
                of
                   system time updates from the RTC and to prevent system time
                   being set when RTC time is behind system time. If RTC time is
                   found to be behind system time a warning is issued regarding
                   potential RTC battery failure.

                2) The 'timeinit-rtc.service' has been added to the new systemd
                   'time-set.target'. This allows for better control and
                   co-ordination between the various time source services.

                3) Systemd dependencies have been updated to ensure that the
                   RTC is the final time service before the 'time-set.target'
                   is reached.

                The 'timeinit-buildtime.sh' script has been updated to use the

                new support functions provided by the 'os-helpers-time' script.

                        A docker-compose.yml with the following structure


                        ```

                        version: '2.1'

                        services:
                          app_1:
                            build: ./noisy-1
                            image: noisy1
                          app_2:

                        ```


                        Will lead to the supervisor creating multiple image
                        database entries

                        with the same dockerId (this is because of how the
                        engine handles this

                        particular case). This case is not handled by the
                        removal process

                        leading to image pile up and increased disk usage.

                        The memory information reported by the supervisor
                        currently

                        estimates the value of used memory as `MemTotal -
                        MemFree`.

                        However, linux systems will try to cache and buffer as
                        much

                        memory as possible, which will affect the output of
                        `MemFree`

                        (from /proc/meminfo) and in consequence the memory usage
                        seen

                        by the user on the dashboard, which will appear much
                        greater than

                        it is.


                        The correct calculation should be `MemTotal - MemFree -
                        Buffers - Cached`,

                        which the calculation performed by `htop` and the `free`
                        commands.

                        In order to make supervisor upgrades more transparent,
                        lets move away

                        from this env var since it requires a container restart
                        any time the supervisor

                        is upgraded. We should ultimately move towards providing
                        the supervisors

                        set of capabilities, but that can come later

                        When trying to apply SSDT overlays in Up Board, the
                        supervisor currently

                        gets stuck in a loop trying to apply target state. See
                        #1465


                        This was due to a bug in parsing the configuration,
                        which lead to

                        the method bootConfigChangeRequired returning true when
                        no change was

                        needed.

                        Each service, when requesting access to the Supervisor
                        API, will

                        now get an individual key which can be scoped to
                        specific resources.

                        In this iteration the default scope will be to the
                        application that

                        the service belongs to.


                        We also have a `global` scope which is used by the cloud
                        API when in

                        managed mode.

                By default chrony uses a random UDP source port for each NTP
                request.

                This can cause problems with particular routers/firewalls
                (issues have

                been reported for the Phicomm KE 2P).


                The chrony `acquisitionport` configuration setting has been
                added

                to the chrony.conf file to change the UDP source port for NTP
                requests

                to 123 (this is the same as the default source port used by both

                ntpdate and ntpd).

                a) restoring time from the drift file is no longer necessary due
                to

                the fake-hwclock service, and

                Currently the system time is maintained over reboots on systems

                without an RTC using the last modified time of the chrony drift
                file.

                However there are a couple of issues with this approach:


                a) /var/lib/chrony/ is not mounted early enough in the boot
                process

                to be available for setting the time before journald is started.

                b) there is an issue with the current systemd dependencies that
                result

                in the last modified time of the drift file not being updated
                when the

                system is shutdown or rebooted (see #1995).


                The Debian fake-hwclock service (as used by Raspberry Pi OS) has
                been

                added to overcome these issues.


                The fake-hwclock service will save and restore the system time
                from

                the fake-hwclock.data file (in /etc/fake-hwclock/). The system
                time

                is loaded from this file at boot and saved to it on shutdown. An

                additional timer service has been added to update the file on an

                hourly basis to cater for unexpected shutdown scenarios, e.g.
                power

                failure.


                The timeinit-timestamp service has improved logging and has been

                renamed to timeinit-buildtime for clarity.


                A new time-set.target has been added as per upstream systemd and

                the fake-hwclock and timeinit-buildtime services have been added

                to it.

              hash: 43a14fef9875f0d0afc23a833cc8e9dc4ae80536
              body: >
                The hostapp update process should not overwrite the supervisor
                configuration

                backend files to avoid the supervisor being forced to set the
                target state

                after HUP and reboot the device during the rollback period.


                This only applies to the host configuration files which are the
                only ones

                that force a reboot.

              hash: 494eeb4a699b4dd5e48547d6e5e45cffb7bf0720

                If the rootfs is on a slow-to-bring-up device (e.g. RPi4 + USB)

                the fsuuidsinit_enabled() function may return before the balena
                symlinks

                are created. This gets wrongly interpreted as missing UUIDs
                leading to

                a chain of failures in the subsequent scripts.

                This patch moves the symlink waiting loop from fsuuidsinit_run()

                to fsuuids_enabled() before the first usage of the symlink.

              hash: 2218cb21d1fc813ac59c08b77046c5d014ad9a42

                We allow the user to specify a custom CA in the .balenaRootCA
                key

                of config.json but at this moment each tool has to implement
                support

                if it wants to use it. This commit adds it to the system-wide CA
                bundle

                so that the CA is respected everywhere.


                Fixes #1398

                        manually resolves the names.

                                The change type is considered 'major' because,
                                by default, errors are

                                now thrown for relatively common occurrences
                                such as authentication

                                failures when pulling from private registries,
                                and library users may

                                have to adapt.

                                        This is a hack, and should be reverted
                                        once we get to the bottom of it.

                                        It will impact performance, but right
                                        now there are things that should

                                        be filtered and are not, so lets get
                                        this merged for security purposes.

                                        Hopefully this library will be
                                        re-written soon.

                                Handlebars supports very basic if condition
                                checking, but it only checks for

                                existence of a field. There are times when we
                                want to combine conditions in order

                                to generate something as part of a blueprint,
                                without defining a completely separate

                                blueprint for it (like generating network config
                                schema if a dt has a wifi chip or

                                a usb port to which we can connect a dongle).

                Recently the supervisor added a codepath that assumes no files
                underneath it will change during runtime.

                OS update hooks can trigger a condition whereby the supervisor
                reboots the device during a HUP,

                which in turn bricks the device.


                Additionally, since unknown args cause this update to
                fail-closed,

                remove that barrier to future-proof more flag expansion.

                On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the
                supervisor moved

                from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit
                creation of

                directories instead of files.


                However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory,
                these have

                to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create
                them.


                This commit checks for the existence of the
                /var/log/supervisor-log

                directory and creates it if required.

                In rocko, systemd kills any script started in background,
                same thing happening to children that get re-parented.

                One solution to this is to use a separate service file for
                starting the healtcheck image load script, after balena.service
                was started.

                Otherwise, as util-linux has a higher default alternative
                priority, the

                version in util-linux is chosen. It would seem they are
                exchangeable, but

                the busybox version reportedly works even if the RTC interrupt
                line is not

                connected.

                On commit a4ce26caadabcb1e87d944d78218cc32c579914e the
                supervisor moved

                from using --volume to using --mount to avoid the implicit
                creation of

                directories instead of files.


                However, in the case where the mount referred to a directory,
                these have

                to exist in the rootfs beforehand as --mount will not create
                them.


                This commit checks for the existence of the
                /resin-data/resin-supervisor

                directory and creates it if required.

                When performing hostOS updates, the resin-logo.png might have

                This commits renames it to the newly branded balena-logo.png


                If the resin-logo.png was unmodified, it will forcefully replace
                to

                balena-logo.png to force rebranding of older resin branded
                release.

                The `docker` Docker Hub repository lists what versions of the
                image

                are supported and 18.6 is not among them at all. Use the current
                stable

                line of 18.09 instead, to stay on supported versions. See more
                info at:

                https://hub.docker.com/_/docker


                For more reproducability, we are also including the patch level
                version

                of the container, which will give us more responsibility to
                update more

                frequently, but fewer surprises.


                Also explicitly set `DOCKER_HOST` for the daemon being started,
                otherwise

                the base image's setting might silently take over, and modify
                this.


                Replace deprecated `-g` (graph driver) with `--data-root` as
                well.

                resin-init has a hardcoded command to disable power management

                on wlan0. This commit moves the logic to udev rule as there is

                no guarantee wlan0 is the only or default wlan adapter in the
                system.


                There seems to be no better way to identify a wlan device in
                udev

                than KERNEL=="wl*" which should match both net.ifnames=0 (wlanX)

                and net.ifnames=1 (wlpX).

                        When invoking iptables-restore it can fail. This wasn't
                        handled

                        and this makes sure that it fails gracefully.

                        In the absence of an upstream implementation of the
                        DeviceRequest API introduced

                        as part of Docker API v1.40 we roll our own using a
                        feature label.


                        As per my comment in the code, we fall back to the
                        default behavior of

                        docker cli's `--gpu` and request single device with the
                        `gpu` capabilty.

                        The only implementation at the moment is the NVIDIA
                        driver; here:

                        https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/blob/master/daemon/nvidia_linux.go

                        We were treating the database class as a singleton, but
                        still having to pass

                        around the db instance. Now we can simply require the db
                        module and have

                        access to the database handle.

                This enables a compressed RAM swap of 25% of total system memory
                or 1GB,

                whichever smallest.


                Upstream Yocto has a zram implementation that's broken in
                warrior, and a

                new implementation introduced in Zeus that does not work in
                BalenaOS as

                we run two udevs, one in the initramfs and one in the main OS.
                The

                mkswap needs to happen in the initramfs udev otherwise the udev
                database

                is not updated with the swap device and the zram0 device is not
                detected

                by systemd.


                This implementation is simpler than the one upstream and common
                to all

                the supported Yocto versions. It uses a udev rule in the
                initramfs that

                creates the swap drive, and a swap unit in the main OS that
                enables it.

              hash: 034ff61a58f30a980514157412c0455b52ddf744
              body: >
                When the user supplies an additional NTP server source which is
                a

                pool URL the 'burst' command may fail. This occurs when the pool

                URL resolves to a different IP addresses for the 'add server'
                and

                'burst' commands.


                To avoid this issue we can combine the burst functionality into
                the

                'add server' command by using the 'iburst' option. Although this

                option is not documented by the chronyc man page it has been
                present

                since v1.25 released in 2011.


                This fix has been tested via the balenaOS (2.51.1+rev1) command
                line

                running on a RPi3.

                Make uboot dev images autoboot delay build time configurable.
                Default is no delay

                Customers usually don't need this delay during u-boot. Also in
                some

                cases, hardware attached on the uart pins might pause uboot
                preventing

                customers from using dev images easily.


                But we do need this delay during our development work on bsps
                etc.


                Lets make this autoboot delay build time configurable


                Also make the BOOTDELAY -2 which is better than 0 as that
                completely

                prevents any char on serial from interrupting boot.

                The default driver is cgroupfs. We switch to systemd so that
                there is

                one cgroup manager in our OS.


                Otherwise, systemd will have its own cgroup manager and cgroupfs
                will

                be another cgroup manager via balenaEngine daemon.


                Fixes #1645 which contains more information

                PR #1441 changed mnt-sysroot-inactive to an automount. But there
                is no

                way to easily add a udev dependency to the automount. As a
                result,

                when rollbacks tries to access the inactive partition, it fails.

                Let's add systemd-udev-settle.service to the rollback services.


                This will only delay the first boot after a HUP which is
                reasonable.

                Our root filesystem is overlayfs or aufs. When latter, the
                system

                crashes when reading a lower directory file. We avoid this by
                always

                falling back to copy and mount (as if overlayfs is not
                available).

                helps a bit in case the device is restarted to recover its

                The fix for this appears to be switching the modem with
                vid and pid 12d1:1f01 from the cdc_ether legacy mode to
                the faster mbim mode and setting mtu=1460 in the modem

                After a HUP, until rollbacks clears its state, the supervisor(or
                user)

                can trigger good reboots. These reboots might be seen by the
                bootloader

                as bad reboots.


                To prevent this from happening, add a service that clears the
                bootcount

                upon good reboots. This only runs if the rollback services have
                not

                cleared their flag files in the state partition.

                U-boot has its own bootcount framework. However, that will
                require

                handling in each device type. We will use u-boot shell commands

                env import -t, env export -t, fatload, fatwrite

                to read/write/increment bootcount in env_resin.h.


                This will allow us to scale to lots of devices.


                A flag os_bootcount_skip is left for devices that are unable to
                support

                fatwrite in u-boot (in some rare cases). This will allow a
                device to

                not support rollback-altboot and still function.


                This patch requires that CMD_SETEXPR be enabled in u-boot config

                options.

                We'd like to enable some options in all boards header files via

                into

                config_default.h (which is included in all board header files).

                We can then add a config option via meta-balena that will be
                enabled for

                all devices.


                This patch enables CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY. If for whatever
                strange reason

                (accidental fs issue in u-boot etc), this will trigger a u-boot
                reset

                command the device in 15 seconds.


                Note This requires that the device's u-boot supports the reset
                command

                which it probably should.

                Occasionally balena ps and balena info work but the balena
                daemon is

                unable to start a new container. This is usually when something
                in runc

                or containerd is not functioning correctly.


                Add a healthcheck to spin up a simple hello-world container as
                well.


                The trade-off here is that there will be a few extra writes to
                disk

                every healthcheck timeout. But there will be a benefit that if
                runc

                or containerd is in a bad state, the healthcheck will fail and
                systemd

                will restart the balena daemon to recover the application
                container

                less

                space whenever an uncompressed image is used anywhere. e.g. when

                extracting the zip to dd or using balena-migrate etc.


                The partition expands on first boot to fill the rest of the disk

                anyways.

                This bbclass uses the common layer path advertised by BBLAYERS
                to find

                the paths to different resources in board repository. For
                example

                machine json - to get the slug and advertise it in os-release.
                After

                renaming the common layer (resin to balena) and because we
                support old

                references to the old common layer name (by including a dummy

                deprecation layer), we need to make sure this class can cope now
                with

                both cases.

                This change backports a PR[1] that is already in systemd and
                will come

                included by default from the version in Yocto warrior.


                In summary, with this change we fix newer NM which stopped
                handling

                rp_filter when connected to multiple interfaces. See "device:
                disable

                rp_filter handling" commit from NM. Without this change, only
                the

                default route will me usable and binding to a specific interface
                will

                break connectivity if that interface is not also the default
                route for

                the target IP.

                Currently, bluez's storage data is set to /var/lib/bluetooth
                which

                in turn is a tmpfs location. We want this location persistent so
                we can

                save paired devices over reboot. We do that by adding the
                corresponding

                bind mount to the state partition and setting bluez to depend on
                this

                mount unit.

                VERSION and VERSION_ID had a slightly different semantics in
                balenaOS.

                VERSION was referring to the BalenaOS (host OS) version (which
                is coming from

                device repositories) while VERSION_ID was set to the
                DISTRO_VERSION.

                This brings confusion so we change it to adhere to

                https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html.

                Since 1.29, busybox switched to an internal implementation of
                the

                resolver based on a feature config, NSLOOKUP_BIG. This is
                enabled by

                default and it's meant to be musl compatible. In BalenaOS we use
                glibc

                and we rely on it for being able to resolve names using NSS
                modules

                (libmdns).

                   Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-36.ucode in place.

                Also, this commit improves the version comparison which was
                comparing

                strings and not integers. Now we try integer comparison and
                fallback to

                string when parse fails.


                Finally, the task's vardeps expands varflags to correctly
                retrigger on

                change.

                This adds set_os_cmdline which defines os_cmdline so that BSPs
                can

                import it in their bootargs and pass it to kernel accordingly.
                Also, as

                part of os_cmdline, there is an argument added when the booted
                image is

                a flasher. This can be used in the OS for various flasher
                specific

                checks.

                Since yocto thud, and more specifically since poky switched to

                openssl 1.1 line, the openssl binary is provided by
                'openssl-bin'. On

                that version, 'openssl' doesn't provide this binary making the
                uuid

                generation script fail.


                This patch makes 'openssl-bin' the default dependency but does
                that in a

                way that older yocto versions can overwrite it back to the old
                provider

                (openssl package).

              hash: b7a6412e6368d3d562ff1ca2fb06be92a24a8548
              body: >
                When we set the udev rule we use IMPORT{program} to know what
                symlinks

                to create in the sysroot directory. The problem is that we don't
                use

                absolute paths and from the documentation udev uses
                /usr/lib/udev as the

                default path while we install the invoked script in /lib/udev.


                ```
                  Execute an external program specified as the assigned value. If no
                  absolute path is given, the program is expected to live in
                  /usr/lib/udev; otherwise, the absolute path must be specified.
                ```


                This PR changes the udev rule to use an absolute path for the

                resin_update_state_probe script. Also it fixes some typos in the
                script

                itself.

              hash: 9571c572e4abcd1ea5951fa408b1543bc40db8c9
              body: >
                Since thud, poky distro file on which balena OS is based,
                already

                includes security_flags.inc. Because of this change, this
                version throws

                a build warning similar to:


                WARNING Duplicate inclusion for
                /build/../layers/poky/meta/conf/distro/include/security_flags.inc

                in
                /build/../layers/meta-resin/meta-balena-thud/conf/distro/include/balena-os-yocto-version.inc


                This happens because again, we import `poky` and
                `security_flags` but

                since thud, poky includes security_flags by default. In order to
                avoid

                this warning we import it (security_flags) now using an .inc
                file at the

                level of the yocto version meta-balena layer. There is as well a
                small

                additional wrinkle here. We switch the include statement from
                `require`

                to `include` so new layers (like thud) don't have to carry this
                hack in

                the future.


                This commit prepares meta-balena for thud support.

                We used to have this patch applied for all the supported yocto
                versions.

                Since thud, this patch is included by default so this change
                backports

                it on all the rest of the supported mate-balena yocto version
                specific

                layers.

                The reason for including this version is that balena-engine
                requires

                newer go compiler and also we want to unify it across our
                supported

                yocto versions to avoid eventual possible runtime issues.

                devtool moves the files from the WORKDIR into
                ${S}/oe-local-files which makes

                copying of env_resin.h fail if the u-boot source is being
                modified using

                devtool. Since devtool also alters FILESPATH to include said
                oe-local-files

                directory, we can iterate over those paths instead of relying on
                WORKDIR.

                balenaOS comes in two flavours, production/development.
                production

                images have various options passed to the kernel cmdline.

                Currently some devices BSPs have those options passed and some
                dont.

                It'll be hard to keep the common options consistent.

                e.g. consoleblank=0 is passed for some devices and not for
                others.


                We'd like the extra options we pass to be in one place. All BSPs
                can

                then append this variable in their respective recipe/bootloader
                config

                etc.

                the build

                then the current kernel-devsrc will create a hardlink of this

                the kernel source tree and then the command:

                tar -czf ${B}/kernel_source.tar.gz -C "$kerneldir/../" .


                will fail like:

                From u-boot docs:

                "Almost all U-Boot commands expect numbers to be entered in
                hexadecimal

                input format"


                We only hit this in the jetson family as the boot partition
                there is

                0xc. Add a simple conversion to hex. This should not affect any
                devices

                that use <9 partition numbers. And allow us to use the same hook

                from meta-balena accross all devices. Currently the jetson
                family has

                its own custom hook with this one-liner.

              hash: 3050840935541c14ded2f9a6a1517d73dfc5ec18
              body: >
                There can be cases where a image type gets invalidated (due to a

                variable change or so) and the dependency of it not. For example
                the img

                type can get invalidated while the hostapp ext3 type doesn't.
                The img

                generatiton script consumes/uses the rootfs generated by the
                hostapp

                type but, it references the artifact based on IMAGE_NAME
                variable which

                includes a time stamp. See bitbake.conf:


                IMAGE_NAME = "${IMAGE_BASENAME}-${MACHINE}-${DATETIME}"


                When that happens, the new timestamp will change and img will
                fail to

                find the old artifact of hostapp. Change this behaviour by using
                the

                symlink reference IMAGE_LINK_NAME which doesn't include a
                timestamp.

                Currently, because we bind mount apps.json unconditionally, when
                this

                file doesn't exist, balena engine will create a directory on the
                data

                filesystem. This breaks when we add an apps.json file after the

                supervisor container was already created.

                Under the current configuration we instruct NetworkManager
                through its

                configuration to completely ignore all the tun devices. This was

                enforced as an extra precation as we run an openvpn client which

                connects to the balena-cloud backend. This client creates, on
                the host,

                the interface `resin-tun` currently (rename pending). We want to
                loosen

                up this restriction to only unmanage this specific device -
                `resin-tun`

                - so that users can take advantage of NetworkManager managing
                other tun

                devices.

                For some reason, using xargs -I a produced spurious difficult to

                errors. Rework test case using a loop. Do the arch check using
                Yoctos

                QA framework that runs on all packages. Otherwise, we'd have to
                manually

                map various compatible arches e.g. aarch64 - arm8, 80386 - x86


                bberror does not exit the do_compile task. Add exit 1 to make
                sure that

                if an error is found, the task is marked as failed. Otherwise
                the

                error becomes a heisenbug as bitbake proceeds after do_compile.

              body: >
                63baa421 introduced a bug where the tools in the header tarballs
                were

                compiled with the incorrect HOSTCC parameter. As a result the
                tools

                inside the tarball were compiled for x86-64 instead of the
                native

                device architecture. And they had the incorrect ld interpreter
                path

                as well.


                Update to v0.0.12 to fix that.

                This release also adds objtool support needed by the intel nuc
                image.

                For now only allow `wifi.scan-rand-mac-address` configurable
                from

                config.json using `randomMacAddressScan` as the json key.


                config.json snippet example:


                "os": {
                  "network" : {
                    "wifi": {

                    }
                  }
                }


                We include a set of tests for this tool which are ran at build
                time.

                The bbappend uses a local `resin-files` directory for additional

                entries but some of these files ended up in `files`. This works
                well if

                the recipe used is the one in the same directory as the `files`

                subdirectory will be used by default. The problem shows when the
                recipe

                is not in the same directoy as bitbake will not be able to find
                needed

                bbappended files.

                The label is actually a udev symlink, but we're keeping

                this naming to be consistent across the file.


                The error seen is that the balena-host service wasn't

                able to start because of a mnt-sysroot-active.service
                dependency:

                resin-partition-mounter[440]: ERROR: Timeout while waiting

                for filesystem label to appear


                By increasing this timeout, the filesystem symlink should

                already exist, at the time the mnt-sysroot-active service is

                looking for this dependency.

    - subject: Specify deps for kernel config task needed for newer (4.16+) kernels
      hash: 92bc21430aba99e7743946e75c153aeff28f4974
      body: |
        We are using newer (4.16+) kernel. For these kernels, we need
        to specify additional dependencies for the configme task.

        This change can be removed when we update poky to a newer version
        that includes 81e8a52e8e40e47c34f900db5d73e69ffc25f5d0.

        This change fixes the error we get on the Nanopi NEO Air kernel when
        our do kernel_resin_reconfigure task will recreate the .config with the
        incorrect kernel config options.

                The original 60s might be slow for some devices where balena
                is busy with a task and the hardware is slow for various
                reasons (ie. Pi1/Zero). In those cases even if the device
                is functioning correctly, the healthcheck will assess the
                device as unhealthy and restart balena and/or the supervisor.

                This patch adds support for translating SSH public keys from
                config.json

                to an authorize_keys file. We use `authorize_keys_local` file as
                the

                destination file of this translation so we can differentiate in
                between keys

                brought locally from config.json and keys brought from the
                balena backend

                through os-config an avoid racing issues with this tool
                (os-config). The final

                `authorize_keys` file will be merged at every ssh connection in
                the dropbear

                service.


                These SSH custom public keys in config.json are assumed to be
                provided

                as an array in `.os.sshKeys`. Example:

                {
                  [...]
                  "os": {
                    "sshKeys": [
                      "ssh-rsa ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
                      "ssh-rsa 0123456789"
                    ]
                  },
                  [...]

                This patch replaces the "Client identifier" option from
                DHCP packets sent by NM to resemble the way udhcpc does it.

                The reason is that the Cisco RV325 router with fw older than
                v1.2.1.14 doesn't reply to DHCP requests or discovery packages
                if the "Client identifier" option is formatted in NM's style.

                Even though this is a bug in the router's fw, we are going to
                fix it here because we encountered clients that couldn't get
                an IP address on these routers and we want to avoid that

                This patch bumps the balena version in meta-resin.


                The update in balena adds support to pass an argument to mobynit
                which

                allows mobynit to mount a rootfs from a custom path.


                The command ./mobynit -sysroot /mnt/sysroot/inactive will mount
                the

                rootfs partition from /mnt/sysroot/inactive and return the
                destination

                path in stdout.

              hash: 3df6e1906e1138a8cd10d15ac3008685b90f75f8
              body: >
                Before multicontainer support in resin, the user container was
                running

                over the host's network stack which means that all the packets
                were

                treated as locally emitted ones. In this case, the communication
                was

                redirected as per the OUTPUT iptable rule only.

                In the "multicontainer world" the user containers run on top of
                bridge

                network which makes the host act as a socksifying router. In
                this case,

                the packets won't go through the OUTPUT chain and the
                redirection to

                redsocks needs to happen at PREROUTING chain.

                This change adds a redirect rule at PREROUTING for TCP packets
                to

                redsocks to redirect packets from the containers to redsocks
                too.


                As well, this adds support for redirecting DNS UDP packets to
                redsocks.

                This is implemented as iptables rules which are only added if
                the

                redsocks configuration has a `dnsu2t` section.

                We would like resin-altboot service to run before balena starts

                resin-altboot checks if the boot configuration is set to run

                resinOS from rootA(B) but we are actually running rootB(A) due
                to

                something.


                If rollback-altboot triggers, it will run hooks to refresh boot
                files

                and reboot. There is no point starting balena in such a device
                state

                as that will only slow down the hooks from running.

                This recipe adds a few systemd services and scripts that handle

                automated OS rollback functionality.


                The rollback-altboot.service checks if we are running in altboot
                mode

                i.e. resinOS_uEnv.txt says we should boot resin_root_part=3. But
                we are

                actually running resinOS from resin_root_part=2. This can happen
                if

                a reboot happened without clearing upgrade_available in
                resinOS_uEnv

                txt file. A kernel panic happened etc.


                The rollback-altboot script runs hostapp-update hooks to change
                the

                bootfiles.


                The rollback-health.service runs rollback-health which checks if
                vpn is

                online and balena is healthy after a hostapp-update.

              body: >
                This patch adds a simple check in env_resin.h.


                If bootcount is found to be greater than bootlimit, switch the

                partitions. Both bootcount and bootlimit are standard u-boot env

                variables.


                To enable rollback in devices, devices have to do the following
                in

                their u-boot


                Enable CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR, CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT and depending
                on the

                device, save the bootcount in some persistant location whether
                that

                is an area in the SoC or an ext partition etc.


                If you are using the CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT driver, use only the
                boot

                partition and use the filename "bootcount.env"


                E.g. for rpi3

                CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR=y

                CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT=y

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_ADDR=0x02300000

                CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT=y

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_EXT_DEVPART=0:1

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_EXT_NAME="bootcount.env"

                Devices that support automated os rollbacks will have two extra

                variables upgrade_available and resin_root_part in their
                grub.cfg

                files.


                Check for the presense of those variables and update them if
                they

                exist.


                Otherwise stick to the previous way of updating grub.cfg


                For devices using grub 2.0, devices will have to mirror the
                pattern

                that exists in u-boot.

                i.e.
                 Add a variable upgrade_available to grub.cfg (HUP hooks update this)
                 Add a variable bootcount to grubenv that increments if
                 upgrade_available is set
                 Add logic in grub.cfg to boot the alternate rootB/A if bootcount
                 reaches 2.

                u-boot uses an upgrade_avaiable flag to update bootcount to
                reduce

                writes to sd card.


                If upgrade_available=0, u-boot won't bother updating the
                bootcount

                variable. During HUP, we'll set upgrade_available=1 so that
                u-boot

                starts counting.


                It'll be the job of the new OS and the rollback services to set

                upgrade_available=0


                For some devices, u-boot will save the bootcount in the boot
                partition

                in /mnt/boot/bootcount.env. Remove that counter when running
                hooks

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ did you mean `read_string`?


                This is just one example of a package that fails like this.
                There are

                multiple packages in the cargo source tree that fail with this
                error.


                The cargo bbclass does a:

                cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release


                This has the following effect:

                NOTE:- cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release.

                Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`


                Updating the registry will result in using the versions pinned
                upstream.

                In our case, it will be using newer versions of packages that
                require a

                newer rust version (read_to_string was added in rust 1.26.0).
                But at the

                same time, the meta-rust layer which we use has an older rust
                version.

                (currently meta-rust on sumo branch has rust at version 1.24.1)


                The fix for such a case would be to use a Cargo.lock file which
                pins

                the packages to versions which are known to work with rust
                1.24.1,

                the version we use in sumo.

        This file allows other components to uniquely parse the information that
        is contained in the changelog. It will be automatically managed by
        versionist by appending the new commits on top. This is needed to
        provide nested-changelogs.
