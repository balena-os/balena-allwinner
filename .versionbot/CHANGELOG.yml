                Customers usually don't need this delay during u-boot. Also in
                some

                cases, hardware attached on the uart pins might pause uboot
                preventing

                customers from using dev images easily.


                But we do need this delay during our development work on bsps
                etc.


                Lets make this autoboot delay build time configurable


                Also make the BOOTDELAY -2 which is better than 0 as that
                completely

                prevents any char on serial from interrupting boot.

        Some patches were part of other linux-mainline

        kernel versions but are not anymore part of the

        current 4.19.76.


        Move 0001-Enable-uart3-for-NanoPi-Neo-Air-used-by-BT.patch

        in linux-mainline_4.19.76.bbappend to avoid error

        patching file arch/arm/boot/dts/sun8i-h3-nanopi-neo-air.dts

        Hunk #2 FAILED at 162.

        1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- rejects in file
        arch/arm/boot/dts/sun8i-h3-nanopi-neo-air.dts


        Place all patches from Armbian in a separate directory and do all the
        Balena specific

        operations in linux-mainline_%.bbappend only.

                PR #1441 changed mnt-sysroot-inactive to an automount. But there
                is no

                way to easily add a udev dependency to the automount. As a
                result,

                when rollbacks tries to access the inactive partition, it fails.

                Let's add systemd-udev-settle.service to the rollback services.


                This will only delay the first boot after a HUP which is
                reasonable.

                Our root filesystem is overlayfs or aufs. When latter, the
                system

                crashes when reading a lower directory file. We avoid this by
                always

                falling back to copy and mount (as if overlayfs is not
                available).

                We have found a rare corner case bug where the journal bloats
                beyond

                its limit and fills the state partition. Triggering a vacuum on
                reboot

                helps a bit in case the device is restarted to recover its
                function.


                Fixes #1423

                Customer reported Huawei E3372 not working
                anymore starting with balenaOS v2.32.
                The fix for this appears to be switching the modem with
                vid and pid 12d1:1f01 from the cdc_ether legacy mode to
                the faster mbim mode and setting mtu=1460 in the modem
                connection file.

                Fix rollback altboots to prevent good reboots by supervisor

                After a HUP, until rollbacks clears its state, the supervisor(or
                user)

                can trigger good reboots. These reboots might be seen by the
                bootloader

                as bad reboots.


                To prevent this from happening, add a service that clears the
                bootcount

                upon good reboots. This only runs if the rollback services have
                not

                cleared their flag files in the state partition.

                U-boot has its own bootcount framework. However, that will
                require

                handling in each device type. We will use u-boot shell commands

                env import -t, env export -t, fatload, fatwrite

                to read/write/increment bootcount in env_resin.h.


                This will allow us to scale to lots of devices.


                A flag os_bootcount_skip is left for devices that are unable to
                support

                fatwrite in u-boot (in some rare cases). This will allow a
                device to

                not support rollback-altboot and still function.


                This patch requires that CMD_SETEXPR be enabled in u-boot config

                options.

                We'd like to enable some options in all boards header files via

                meta-balena. This patch adds a task to include config_resin.h
                into

                config_default.h (which is included in all board header files).

                We can then add a config option via meta-balena that will be
                enabled for

                all devices.


                This patch enables CONFIG_RESET_TO_RETRY. If for whatever
                strange reason

                (accidental fs issue in u-boot etc), this will trigger a u-boot
                reset

                command the device in 15 seconds.


                Note This requires that the device's u-boot supports the reset
                command

                which it probably should.

                The data partition contains the supervisor which is only about
                61M on

                the pi3. We compress the data partition later on so don't notice
                these

                zeros. But lets reduce the size of the data partition to eat
                less

                space whenever an uncompressed image is used anywhere. e.g. when

                extracting the zip to dd or using balena-migrate etc.


                The partition expands on first boot to fill the rest of the disk

                anyways.

                This bbclass uses the common layer path advertised by BBLAYERS
                to find

                the paths to different resources in board repository. For
                example

                machine json - to get the slug and advertise it in os-release.
                After

                renaming the common layer (resin to balena) and because we
                support old

                references to the old common layer name (by including a dummy

                deprecation layer), we need to make sure this class can cope now
                with

                both cases.

                This change backports a PR[1] that is already in systemd and

                included by default from the version in Yocto warrior.


                In summary, with this change we fix newer NM which stopped
                handling

                rp_filter when connected to multiple interfaces. See "device:
                disable

                rp_filter handling" commit from NM. Without this change, only
                the

                default route will me usable and binding to a specific interface
                will

                break connectivity if that interface is not also the default
                route for

                the target IP.

                in turn is a tmpfs location. We want this location persistent so
                we can

                save paired devices over reboot. We do that by adding the
                corresponding

                this

                We have been deprecating these layers since v2.30.0. It's time
                to drop

                this support completely.

                VERSION and VERSION_ID had a slightly different semantics in
                balenaOS.

                VERSION was referring to the BalenaOS (host OS) version (which
                is coming from

                device repositories) while VERSION_ID was set to the
                DISTRO_VERSION.

                This brings confusion so we change it to adhere to

                https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html.

                Since 1.29, busybox switched to an internal implementation of
                the

                resolver based on a feature config, NSLOOKUP_BIG. This is
                enabled by

                default and it's meant to be musl compatible. In BalenaOS we use
                glibc

                and we rely on it for being able to resolve names using NSS
                modules

                (libmdns).

                kept

                firmwares. For example:

                 Cleaning iwlwifi firmware version 8000C to minimum API version 34.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-13.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-22.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-21.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-31.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-16.ucode.
                   Removing iwlwifi-8000C-27.ucode.
                   Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-34.ucode in place.
                   Leaving iwlwifi-8000C-36.ucode in place.

                Also, this commit improves the version comparison which was
                comparing

                strings and not integers. Now we try integer comparison and
                fallback to

                string when parse fails.


                Finally, the task's vardeps expands varflags to correctly
                retrigger on

                change.

                Since yocto thud, and more specifically since poky switched to

                openssl 1.1 line, the openssl binary is provided by
                'openssl-bin'. On

                that version, 'openssl' doesn't provide this binary making the
                uuid

                This patch makes 'openssl-bin' the default dependency but does
                that in a

                way that older yocto versions can overwrite it back to the old
                provider

                (openssl package).

                When we set the udev rule we use IMPORT{program} to know what
                symlinks

                to create in the sysroot directory. The problem is that we don't
                use

                absolute paths and from the documentation udev uses
                /usr/lib/udev as the

                default path while we install the invoked script in /lib/udev.


                ```
                  Execute an external program specified as the assigned value. If no
                  absolute path is given, the program is expected to live in
                  /usr/lib/udev; otherwise, the absolute path must be specified.
                ```


                This PR changes the udev rule to use an absolute path for the

                resin_update_state_probe script. Also it fixes some typos in the
                script

                itself.

              hash: 9571c572e4abcd1ea5951fa408b1543bc40db8c9

                Since thud, poky distro file on which balena OS is based,
                already

                includes security_flags.inc. Because of this change, this
                version throws

                a build warning similar to:


                WARNING Duplicate inclusion for
                /build/../layers/poky/meta/conf/distro/include/security_flags.inc

                in
                /build/../layers/meta-resin/meta-balena-thud/conf/distro/include/balena-os-yocto-version.inc


                This happens because again, we import `poky` and
                `security_flags` but

                since thud, poky includes security_flags by default. In order to
                avoid

                this warning we import it (security_flags) now using an .inc
                file at the

                level of the yocto version meta-balena layer. There is as well a
                small

                additional wrinkle here. We switch the include statement from
                `require`

                to `include` so new layers (like thud) don't have to carry this
                hack in

                the future.


                This commit prepares meta-balena for thud support.

                We used to have this patch applied for all the supported yocto
                versions.

                Since thud, this patch is included by default so this change
                backports

                it on all the rest of the supported mate-balena yocto version
                specific

                layers.

                The reason for including this version is that balena-engine
                requires

                newer go compiler and also we want to unify it across our
                supported

                yocto versions to avoid eventual possible runtime issues.

                devtool moves the files from the WORKDIR into

                modified using

                devtool. Since devtool also alters FILESPATH to include said
                oe-local-files

                directory, we can iterate over those paths instead of relying on
                WORKDIR.

                balenaOS comes in two flavours, production/development.
                production

                images have various options passed to the kernel cmdline.

                Currently some devices BSPs have those options passed and some
                dont.

                It'll be hard to keep the common options consistent.

                e.g. consoleblank=0 is passed for some devices and not for
                others.


                We'd like the extra options we pass to be in one place. All BSPs
                can

                then append this variable in their respective recipe/bootloader
                config

                etc.

                It is best to not create anything in ${B} even if just temporary
                because

                it alters the directory in ways which can break other parts of
                the build

                system. For example, if there is a leftover kernel_source.tar.gz
                in B,

                then the current kernel-devsrc will create a hardlink of this
                file in

                the kernel source tree and then the command:

                tar -czf ${B}/kernel_source.tar.gz -C "$kerneldir/../" .


                will fail like:

                By default, chrony will slowly and gracefully take measurements
                from

                the new ntp server. The burst 4/10 command will make chrony take
                4 good

                measurements within 2 seconds each. It will try up to 10 times.

                when

                starts

                From u-boot docs:

                "Almost all U-Boot commands expect numbers to be entered in
                hexadecimal

                input format"


                We only hit this in the jetson family as the boot partition
                there is

                0xc. Add a simple conversion to hex. This should not affect any
                devices

                that use <9 partition numbers. And allow us to use the same hook

                from meta-balena accross all devices. Currently the jetson
                family has

                its own custom hook with this one-liner.

                We have noticed devices in support that show high cpu usage
                because

                the process chronyc online seems to be eating up 50% cpu.


                This is probably fixed upstream

              hash: 3050840935541c14ded2f9a6a1517d73dfc5ec18
              body: >
                There can be cases where a image type gets invalidated (due to a

                variable change or so) and the dependency of it not. For example
                the img

                type can get invalidated while the hostapp ext3 type doesn't.
                The img

                generatiton script consumes/uses the rootfs generated by the
                hostapp

                type but, it references the artifact based on IMAGE_NAME
                variable which

                includes a time stamp. See bitbake.conf:


                IMAGE_NAME = "${IMAGE_BASENAME}-${MACHINE}-${DATETIME}"


                When that happens, the new timestamp will change and img will
                fail to

                find the old artifact of hostapp. Change this behaviour by using
                the

                symlink reference IMAGE_LINK_NAME which doesn't include a
                timestamp.

                Currently, because we bind mount apps.json unconditionally, when
                this

                file doesn't exist, balena engine will create a directory on the
                data

                filesystem. This breaks when we add an apps.json file after the

                supervisor container was already created.

                For some reason, using xargs -I a produced spurious difficult to
                trace

                errors. Rework test case using a loop. Do the arch check using
                Yoctos

                QA framework that runs on all packages. Otherwise, we'd have to
                manually

                map various compatible arches e.g. aarch64 - arm8, 80386 - x86


                bberror does not exit the do_compile task. Add exit 1 to make
                sure that

                if an error is found, the task is marked as failed. Otherwise
                the

                error becomes a heisenbug as bitbake proceeds after do_compile.

              body: >
                63baa421 introduced a bug where the tools in the header tarballs
                were

                compiled with the incorrect HOSTCC parameter. As a result the
                tools

                inside the tarball were compiled for x86-64 instead of the
                native

                device architecture. And they had the incorrect ld interpreter
                path

                as well.


                Update to v0.0.12 to fix that.

                This release also adds objtool support needed by the intel nuc
                image.

                For now only allow `wifi.scan-rand-mac-address` configurable
                from

                config.json using `randomMacAddressScan` as the json key.


                config.json snippet example:


                "os": {
                  "network" : {
                    "wifi": {
                      "randomMacAddressScan": false
                    }
                  }
                }


                We include a set of tests for this tool which are ran at build
                time.


                Fixes #1294

                The bbappend uses a local `resin-files` directory for additional
                file

                entries but some of these files ended up in `files`. This works
                well if

                the recipe used is the one in the same directory as the `files`

                subdirectory will be used by default. The problem shows when the
                recipe

                is not in the same directoy as bitbake will not be able to find
                needed

                bbappended files.

                The label is actually a udev symlink, but we're keeping

                this naming to be consistent across the file.


                The error seen is that the balena-host service wasn't

                able to start because of a mnt-sysroot-active.service
                dependency:

                resin-partition-mounter[440]: ERROR: Timeout while waiting

                for filesystem label to appear


                By increasing this timeout, the filesystem symlink should

                already exist, at the time the mnt-sysroot-active service is

                looking for this dependency.

    - subject: Specify deps for kernel config task needed for newer (4.16+) kernels
      hash: 92bc21430aba99e7743946e75c153aeff28f4974
      body: |
        We are using newer (4.16+) kernel. For these kernels, we need
        to specify additional dependencies for the configme task.

        This change can be removed when we update poky to a newer version
        that includes 81e8a52e8e40e47c34f900db5d73e69ffc25f5d0.

        This change fixes the error we get on the Nanopi NEO Air kernel when
        our do kernel_resin_reconfigure task will recreate the .config with the
        incorrect kernel config options.

                The original 60s might be slow for some devices where balena
                is busy with a task and the hardware is slow for various
                reasons (ie. Pi1/Zero). In those cases even if the device
                is functioning correctly, the healthcheck will assess the
                device as unhealthy and restart balena and/or the supervisor.

                The current implementation checks for the existance of the
                `flash-boot`

                label. This breaks when after flashing the flashing device is
                left

                plugged. Change this with a check based on the root kernel
                argument.

                This patch adds support for translating SSH public keys from
                config.json

                to an authorize_keys file. We use `authorize_keys_local` file as
                the

                destination file of this translation so we can differentiate in
                between keys

                brought locally from config.json and keys brought from the
                balena backend

                through os-config an avoid racing issues with this tool
                (os-config). The final

                `authorize_keys` file will be merged at every ssh connection in
                the dropbear

                service.


                These SSH custom public keys in config.json are assumed to be
                provided

                as an array in `.os.sshKeys`. Example:

                {
                  [...]
                  "os": {
                    "sshKeys": [
                      "ssh-rsa ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
                      "ssh-rsa 0123456789"
                    ]
                  },

                This patch replaces the "Client identifier" option from
                DHCP packets sent by NM to resemble the way udhcpc does it.

                The reason is that the Cisco RV325 router with fw older than
                v1.2.1.14 doesn't reply to DHCP requests or discovery packages
                if the "Client identifier" option is formatted in NM's style.

                Even though this is a bug in the router's fw, we are going to
                fix it here because we encountered clients that couldn't get
                an IP address on these routers and we want to avoid that

                treated as locally emitted ones. In this case, the communication
                was

                redirected as per the OUTPUT iptable rule only.

                In the "multicontainer world" the user containers run on top of
                bridge

                network which makes the host act as a socksifying router. In
                this case,

                the packets won't go through the OUTPUT chain and the
                redirection to

                redsocks needs to happen at PREROUTING chain.

                This change adds a redirect rule at PREROUTING for TCP packets
                to

                redsocks to redirect packets from the containers to redsocks
                too.


                As well, this adds support for redirecting DNS UDP packets to
                redsocks.

                This is implemented as iptables rules which are only added if
                the

                redsocks configuration has a `dnsu2t` section.

                We would like resin-altboot service to run before balena starts

                resin-altboot checks if the boot configuration is set to run

                resinOS from rootA(B) but we are actually running rootB(A) due
                to

                something.


                If rollback-altboot triggers, it will run hooks to refresh boot
                files

                and reboot. There is no point starting balena in such a device
                state

                as that will only slow down the hooks from running.

                This recipe adds a few systemd services and scripts that handle

                automated OS rollback functionality.


                The rollback-altboot.service checks if we are running in altboot
                mode

                i.e. resinOS_uEnv.txt says we should boot resin_root_part=3. But
                we are

                actually running resinOS from resin_root_part=2. This can happen
                if

                a reboot happened without clearing upgrade_available in
                resinOS_uEnv

                txt file. A kernel panic happened etc.


                The rollback-altboot script runs hostapp-update hooks to change
                the

                bootfiles.


                The rollback-health.service runs rollback-health which checks if
                vpn is

                online and balena is healthy after a hostapp-update.

              body: >
                This patch adds a simple check in env_resin.h.


                If bootcount is found to be greater than bootlimit, switch the

                partitions. Both bootcount and bootlimit are standard u-boot env

                variables.


                To enable rollback in devices, devices have to do the following
                in

                their u-boot


                Enable CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR, CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT and depending
                on the

                device, save the bootcount in some persistant location whether
                that

                is an area in the SoC or an ext partition etc.


                If you are using the CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT driver, use only the
                boot

                partition and use the filename "bootcount.env"


                E.g. for rpi3

                CONFIG_CMD_SETEXPR=y

                CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_LIMIT=y

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_ADDR=0x02300000

                CONFIG_BOOTCOUNT_EXT=y

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_EXT_DEVPART=0:1

                CONFIG_SYS_BOOTCOUNT_EXT_NAME="bootcount.env"

                Devices that support automated os rollbacks will have two extra

                variables upgrade_available and resin_root_part in their
                grub.cfg

                files.


                Check for the presense of those variables and update them if
                they

                exist.


                Otherwise stick to the previous way of updating grub.cfg


                For devices using grub 2.0, devices will have to mirror the
                pattern

                that exists in u-boot.

                i.e.
                 Add a variable upgrade_available to grub.cfg (HUP hooks update this)
                 Add a variable bootcount to grubenv that increments if
                 upgrade_available is set
                 Add logic in grub.cfg to boot the alternate rootB/A if bootcount
                 reaches 2.

                u-boot uses an upgrade_avaiable flag to update bootcount to
                reduce

                writes to sd card.


                If upgrade_available=0, u-boot won't bother updating the
                bootcount

                variable. During HUP, we'll set upgrade_available=1 so that
                u-boot

                starts counting.


                It'll be the job of the new OS and the rollback services to set

                upgrade_available=0


                For some devices, u-boot will save the bootcount in the boot
                partition

                in /mnt/boot/bootcount.env. Remove that counter when running
                hooks

                `fs`

                let config =
                fs::read_to_string("libssh2/src/libssh2_config_cmake.h.in")

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ did you mean `read_string`?


                This is just one example of a package that fails like this.
                There are

                multiple packages in the cargo source tree that fail with this
                error.


                The cargo bbclass does a:

                cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release


                This has the following effect:

                NOTE:- cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release.

                Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`


                Updating the registry will result in using the versions pinned
                upstream.

                In our case, it will be using newer versions of packages that
                require a

                newer rust version (read_to_string was added in rust 1.26.0).
                But at the

                same time, the meta-rust layer which we use has an older rust
                version.

                (currently meta-rust on sumo branch has rust at version 1.24.1)


                The fix for such a case would be to use a Cargo.lock file which
                pins

                the packages to versions which are known to work with rust
                1.24.1,

                the version we use in sumo.

                Pin down cargo deps (using Cargo.lock) to versions known working

              hash: ef3e76f2d343e8cd367214b4b5ce52b3b97be262

                With Sumo 19.0.1, when building cargo 0.25.0 we get:

                | error[E0425]: cannot find function `read_to_string` in module
                `fs`

                |   -->
                /yocto/resin-board/build/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/cargo-native/

                0.25.0-r0/cargo_home/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/

                libssh2-sys-0.2.11/build.rs:99:26

                let config =
                fs::read_to_string("libssh2/src/libssh2_config_cmake.h.in")

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ did you mean `read_string`?


                This is just one example of a package that fails like this.
                There are

                multiple packages in the cargo source tree that fail with this
                error.


                The cargo bbclass does a:

                cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release


                This has the following effect:

                NOTE:- cargo build -v --target x86_64-linux --release.

                Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`


                Updating the registry will result in using the versions pinned
                upstream.

                In our case, it will be using newer versions of packages that
                require a

                newer rust version (read_to_string was added in rust 1.26.0).
                But at the

                same time, the meta-rust layer which we use has an older rust
                version.

                (currently meta-rust on sumo branch has rust at version 1.24.1)


                The fix for such a case would be to use a Cargo.lock file which
                pins

                the packages to versions which are known to work with rust
                1.24.1,

                the version we use in sumo.

        This file allows other components to uniquely parse the information that
        is contained in the changelog. It will be automatically managed by
        versionist by appending the new commits on top. This is needed to
        provide nested-changelogs.
